    "**Ans:** \n",
    "Variable: Variable is a memory location denoted using an alphabet or a group of alphabets ('_' can be used for naming variables) which can be used to store data temporarily during the execution of a program. Each variable will be having a data type of its own. Eg: int x => Here 'x' is a variable with type as integer which can be used to store integer values.\n",

    "String: A string is a sequence of characters which are represented using quotes at both ends. eg: \"Vishnu\" , 'Raj'. A string can be stored inside a variable to work with it inside a program. In python the word 'String' also represents the data type 'str' which can be used to declaring variables for storing string values.Eg: str word = \"Vishnu\" => Here 'word' is variable of 'str' type, which is used to store the string 'Vishnu'.\n"

    "\n",

Key-value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized. Each key-value pair in a Dictionary is separated by a colon :, whereas each key is separated by a ‘comma’. eg: {1: [1, 2, 3, 4], 'Name': 'Vishnu'}\n"
